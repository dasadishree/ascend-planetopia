project made for ascend 2024, first all-girls summit and hackathon in los angeles run by hackclub, 1 of 50 participnts internationally.

During Hack Club Ascend, we were tasked with designing a planet and asked, "What would be a planet you would want to visit?" Through brainstorming, we realized that there's no single right answer to this question. Everyone has their own vision of utopia, and our project reflects that diversity. Despite facing challenges such as coding errors and occasional confusion about our direction, we achieved what we call a "mission success." Start your own journey by clicking "blast off," create your own planet, and explore its background with a personal tour guide!
